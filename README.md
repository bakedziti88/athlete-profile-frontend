# Athlete Profile Form Frontend

A frontend, single page application type of website for an athlete profile form. Written in AngularJS.

## About

The setup is taken from Angular seed. It has routes set up but as far as modules go, there are only 3 modules in addition to the root. The main list uses directives but would better be suited if made with components. There are some simple filters and templates thrown in as well to help out. Overall it is very simple but the logic + layout are almost exactly as I want it. A lot of time was spent on creating a huge form for many different inputs, which could also be done a little better if there was more time. 

## Features

* Add an athlete to the database
* View other athletes

## Future Work

* Expanded validation of the form
* Progress bar for the form
* Multi-step for the form so it's not all on one page
* Profile pictures
* Refactor templates into smaller chunks + reusable components
* Tidy up minor formatting
